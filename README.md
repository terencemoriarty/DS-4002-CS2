## Data

The Data folder contains the two .csv files relevant to this project. The first, "2022 MLB Player Stats - Batting.csv", gives the name, age, team, league, and batting statistics for each MLB hiter from the 2022 season. Some of the abbrevations for statistics may not be obvious, but their meanings can be found on the MLB's website [here](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats)[3].

The second dataset, "MLB Salaries - 2022.csv", contains salary information for each MLB player during the 2022 season. The data dictionary for this dataset is provided below

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Player      | The player's name, in "Last, First" format. |
| Pos'n       | The player's position. |
| MLS         | The player's Major League Service Time, a measure of how long a player has been in the MLB. It is significant for salary purposes because players become eligible for larger contracts with more Major League Service Time.|

## Rubric
