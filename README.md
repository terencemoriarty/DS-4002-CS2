# Identifying Underpaid and Overpaid MLB Hitters

## Contents of the Repository

This repository includes all of the necessary files for a student to complete the Identifying Underpaid and Overpaid MLB Hitters project. This README.md file contains an overview of what is included in the repository. The LICENSE.md file explains to a visitor the terms under which they may use and cite this repository. The Hook document is intended to be the first way the student engages with the project. The Materials folder contains two relevant external sources that help to further frame the assignment. The Data folder contains all of the data for the project. The Rubric describes how the student will be evaluated on this project.

## Hook

As mentioned above, the Hook document is intended to be the first way the student engages with the project. It provides the scenario that the students will be placing themselves in, and also gives a brief overview of what deliverables will be required.

## Materials

The Materials folder contains two PDF documents that could be helpful for a student completing this project. "Moneyball 20 Years Later.pdf" gives context regarding the <i>Moneyball</i> story referenced in the hook document, and elaborates on how other MLB teams and teams in other professional sports leagues are now embracing data-driven strategies to fuel on-field performance [1].

"Analysis_Of_Salary_For_MLB_Players.pdf" is a thesis from Michael Glenn Hoffman, a Statistics major at North Dakota State University. While it is on a scale beyond the scope of this assignment, this thesis includes an attempt to identify if MLB players are underpaid or overpaid [2]. Aspects of Hoffman's thesis and model-building approach may serve as inspiration to a student completing this assignment.

## Data

The Data folder contains the two .csv files relevant to this project. The first, "2022 MLB Player Stats - Batting.csv", gives the name, age, team, league, and batting statistics for each MLB hiter from the 2022 season. Some of the abbrevations for statistics may not be obvious, but their meanings can be found on the MLB's website [here](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats) [3].

The second dataset, "MLB Salaries - 2022.csv", contains salary information for each MLB player during the 2022 season. The data dictionary for this dataset is provided below:

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Player      | The player's name, in "Last, First" format. |
| Pos'n       | The player's position. |
| MLS         | The player's Major League Service Time, a measure of how long a player has been in the MLB. It is significant for salary purposes because players become eligible for larger contracts with more Major League Service Time.|
| 2022        | The player's salary for the 2022 MLB season. |

## Rubric

The rubric provides guidance as to how a student will be evaluated on the project. The document begins by explaining the goals of the assingment, giving an overview of what the student is tasked with, and laying out tips for success. A rubric describing what features are necessary to meet specification for each of the three primary deliverables is also included.
